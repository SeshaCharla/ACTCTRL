\subsection{Robust feedback control design}

Adding model uncertainties to the error dynamics
(\ref{eqn::error_dyn_model_comp}), we get:
\begin{align}
    \dot z &= \tilde \phi^T \theta - \phi^T_d \tilde \theta + bu_s - \tilde b u_m  + d\label{eqn::error_dyn_model_comp_unc}
\end{align}

The left side of (\ref{eqn::error_feedback_dyn}) represents the stable nominal
closed-loop dynamics. The terms in the brackets of the right hand side
represents the effect of all model uncertainties. Though these terms are
unknown, but they are bounded above with some known function h(x, t).
